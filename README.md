# Project Description:
In today's technology dependent world, a power outage can lead to so much more than a lack of electricity â€” it leads to a lack of normal life. In this project we were interested in the features that would contribute to larger outages. We then built a machine learning model to try and predict whether a power outage is a major one.

We dive into a dataset that includes major power outage data in the continental US from January 2000 to July 2016. A major power outage can be defined as a power outage that impacted at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned firm load loss of at least 300 megawatts. 

The Jupyter Notebook contains all our code and findings. The CSV file contains our dataset of outages, and the article linked contains a description of all the column features.
